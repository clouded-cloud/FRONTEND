# TODO: Debug Axios Error in getOrders

- [x] Add detailed error logging in RecentOrders.jsx to capture Axios error details (status, response, etc.)
- [x] Implement role-based access control to restrict dashboard access to admin users only
- [ ] Guide user to check if backend server is running and accessible at VITE_BACKEND_URL
- [ ] Verify environment variables (VITE_BACKEND_URL) are set correctly
- [ ] Test the /api/orders endpoint manually (e.g., via curl or Postman)
- [ ] Run the app and check browser console for logged errors
